Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Seaborn Internal Datasets: Iris and Flights

Description:
The project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two internal datasets provided by the Seaborn library in Python: the Iris dataset and the Flights dataset. EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis process, allowing us to gain insights, identify patterns, and understand the main characteristics of the data.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of measurements of iris flowers, including sepal and petal dimensions, along with the species of the iris. On the other hand, the Flights dataset contains information about the number of passengers traveling in each month across different years.

The project involves loading these datasets, examining their structure and contents, and then utilizing various Seaborn visualization techniques to explore and analyze the data. The following tasks are performed:

1. Data Loading: The datasets are loaded into the Python environment using Seaborn's built-in functions.

2. Data Inspection: The structure and contents of both datasets are examined to gain an understanding of the variables and their types.

3. Visualization Techniques:
   - For the Iris dataset:
     - Pairplot: Visualize pairwise relationships between variables and distinguish species using different colors.
     - Boxplot: Display the distribution of each variable across different species.
   
   - For the Flights dataset:
     - Heatmap: Show the passenger counts across months and years using a color-coded heatmap.
     - Line Plot: Visualize the trend of passenger counts over the years.
   
4. Interpretation: The generated visualizations are analyzed to extract insights and patterns from the data. This includes understanding relationships between variables, identifying trends, and detecting any anomalies or interesting observations.

5. Conclusion: A summary of key findings and insights obtained from the EDA process is provided. This may include recommendations for further analysis or potential areas for investigation.

Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of EDA techniques using Seaborn on real-world datasets, offering valuable insights into data exploration and analysis methodologies.
